# Linkedin-Bot-Connection
Using a bot on Python to send connexion with a note to the CEOs of all my referenced companies.

This Linkedin Bot is my first bot in Python. So it may not work 100%. For a growth hacking's project : I tried to collect data on French startups. Except these data are inaccessible and sometimes very private. So I decided, from a list of startups referenced by my previous day, to find their CEOs on LinkedIn and to send them a connection request with a note integrated in it leading to my questionnaire. As this questionnaire is directly linked to my database, everything is automated.  In this project, however, the script to find the URLs of the profiles I will add later is missing. This script goes directly through the google API.
